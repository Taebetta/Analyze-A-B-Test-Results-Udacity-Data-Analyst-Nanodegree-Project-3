## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

In this project, I analysed the A/B testing result from the e-commerce website. I started the project by cleaning data, setting up hypotheses, calculate probability and conduct the hypothesis testing.

## Udacity's Project Instruction <a name="instruction"></a>
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Result <a name="result"></a>

In conclusion, the hypothesis test show the failure to reject the null hypothesis which is the old page is perform equally or better than the new page ( $H_0$: $p_{new}$ <= $p_{old}$ ). Additionally, none of the variables show significant level of p-value to reject the null hypothesis. In practice, the analysis hasn't had enough evidence to support that the new page has a better performance in conversion than the old page.</font>
